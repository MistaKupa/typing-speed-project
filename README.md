## Overview

### Features

- WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation
- Accuracy tracking - Difficulty selection
- 1-minute countdown timer
- Results summary screen

## Process

I joined the hackathon in the final week. My focus was on core logic and state management in React. I wanted to separate it into multiple components as for best practices and finish as much as possible as for selflearning I would like feedback, but due to time constraints (and traveling for a wedding to differen country!), the app is currently "optimized" for desktop only.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind
- useState, useEffect, useCallback

## What I learned

- Managing timers in React.
- Handling real-time keyboard input and validation.
- Using useCallback functions.
